  // noise floor, and roughly half the storage of the full float.
  // WHY IT IS NOT A KNOB: the grader reads back the very same rounded numbers
  // the recorder saved, so a sign graded in the browser can be re-graded from
  // the stored data and come out identical. Two places to set the precision
  // means they can disagree, and then one number is graded and a different one
  // is saved, with nothing to say which is right. Change DECIMALS if the
  // precision itself is wrong; putting a `decimals` back here throws at
  // startup (js/core/recorder.js).

  // Also hand the participant a JSON copy of their session summary (the same
  // document that goes to Firebase: identity, settings, and the per-trial

  // go to Firebase. Useful while piloting; leave off for real collection.
