/* asl-study.js: JT's fixed three-part study (2026-09-21), as one task.
 *
 *   1. BASELINE   every letter once, letter only, no picture: the first hold
 *                 is recorded and the trial ends. The learner is told only
 *                 that it was recorded -- the ring and its (orange) burst
 *                 say the hold was taken, never right/wrong.       5 x 1 = 5
 *   2. TEACHING   every letter ten times, letter WITH its picture. A right
 *                 hold ends the trial (green burst, "Good job"); a wrong one
 *                 gets the hint.                                  5 x 10 = 50
 *   3. POST-TEST  as the baseline.                                5 x 1 = 5
 *
 * All 26 letters by default (JT 2026-09-25, the first data collection);
 * ?letters=BDFIV is the five-letter demo shown to Karen (DEMO_LETTERS).
 *
 * Every part is made of shuffled passes through the alphabet (a pass = each
 * letter once), seeded from the participant id, so no letter is seen twice
 * before every letter has been seen once. The questionnaire before is
 * questions.js (DEMOGRAPHIC_QUESTIONS); the one after is POST_QUESTIONS.
 *
 * The per-frame machinery is the tutor's (experiments/asl-tutor/engine.js and
 * flow.js: the hold-still ring, the grader, the hints, the pacing); what this
 * file owns is WHICH trial comes next and the study's stripped-down screen
 * (ui.js layout "study": the camera, the letter with its ring, the picture).
 *
 * URL: ?exp=asl-study   [&letters=…] [&reps=2,10,2] [&seed=n] [&debug=1]
 * `reps` shortens a run for trying it out; the numbers are logged. */
