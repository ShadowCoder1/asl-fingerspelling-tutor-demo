/* replay.js: run the whole page from a recorded file instead of a camera.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * Everything downstream of the tracker -- the trial loop, the recorder, an
 * experiment's onFrame, the results screen -- is ordinary code that can be
 * wrong in ordinary ways. None of it could be exercised without a person, a
 * webcam and good light, so none of it was ever checked automatically. Replay
 * mode swaps ONLY the two things that need hardware (the camera and MediaPipe)
 * for a file of landmarks that were recorded once. The rest of the page is the
 * same page a participant gets, which is the whole point: a test that runs a
 * special code path proves things about the special code path.
 *
 *   index.html?exp=asl-probe&replay=tests/fixtures/replay-hand.json
 *
 * THE FILE FORMAT (tools/make-replay-fixture.mjs writes one):
 *   { "video": { "width": 640, "height": 480 },
 *     "fps": 30,
 *     "frames": [ { "lm": number[63]|null,    image landmarks, as recorded
 *                   "wl": number[63]|null,    world landmarks, meters
 *                   "h":  "L"|"R"|null,       MediaPipe's label, as reported
 *                   "hs": number|null }, … ] }  …and its confidence
 * which is deliberately the same per-frame shape the recorder saves, so a real
 * session downloaded from Firestore can be replayed later without conversion.
 *
 * NOTHING IS EVER UPLOADED IN REPLAY MODE. The landmarks in the file are not
 * this participant's data -- there is no participant -- so js/core/experiment.js
 * forces demo mode when a replay is requested, whether or not Firebase is
 * configured, and says so on screen.
 *
 * This file also holds the `?autorun=1` clicker and the two machine-readable
 * markers the headless smoke test reads (tools/e2e-smoke.sh). They live here
 * rather than in the runner because they are all one thing: the harness that
 * lets the page run with nobody sitting in front of it. */

/* A replay path comes out of the URL, so it is the one part of replay mode
 * that somebody else chooses. It may only name a .json file sitting next to
 * the page: no parent directories, no absolute paths, no other origin, no
 * other file type. The page would refuse to parse anything else anyway, but a
 * URL that can make the page fetch an arbitrary address is worth closing off
 * on its own account. */

 * Read both replay switches out of a URL, together.
 *
 * They are read in one place because `autorun=1` is only safe in replay mode:
 * it ticks the consent boxes and clicks every button, so on a real
 * participant's link it would consent on their behalf. It is therefore
 * IGNORED unless a valid `replay=` file was asked for as well.
 *
 * WHY `present` IS SEPARATE FROM `valid`. A mistyped path cannot hurt a
 * participant -- it is refused, and their link never carries `replay=` anyway.
 * The person it can hurt is whoever typed it: they believe they are replaying a
 * file and that nothing will be saved, and a runner that treated "unusable" the
 * same as "absent" would quietly give them a LIVE CAMERA session that uploads.
 * So the runner is told the difference and stops (js/core/experiment.js). A
 * well-formed path that is not there already fails loudly with a 404; a
 * malformed one has to fail just as loudly.
